# Nice Charts

This is a collection of financial charts I made with react-vis and vx-charts/visx for projects of mine. 
Sharing these in case anyone else finds them useful, feel free to open up a PR if there are any you would like to add.
Inspiration came from https://github.com/hshoff/viewsource.

react-vis: https://github.com/uber/react-vis
`yarn add react-vis`

vx/visx: https://github.com/airbnb/visx
`yarn add @vx/vx`
